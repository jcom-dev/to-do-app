- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [next](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How To Use

Run the development server:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/jcom-dev/to-do-app

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
